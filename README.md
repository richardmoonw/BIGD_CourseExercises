# Big Data Exercises
------
This repository contains the evidence of all the major exercises done during the Big Data course. 

## Assessments.
As it is said in the previous paragraph, since the repository contains multiple mini projects, they will be described separately in the documentation. The projects that are included are the following:
1. FirstAssessment.

### FirstAssessment
It was requested to predict the sale price for a given car through the analysis of the data contained in a determined dataset. To achieve the result there were required some processes as cleaning and selection, data transformation, data mining and prediction model generation.

Since the project was done in a Python Notebook, you can open it with Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab (we extremely recommend this option because it is not a complex nor extremely large file).

You can find all the required files to run the project in the **/FirstAssessment** folder of this repository.
